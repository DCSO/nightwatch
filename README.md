Nightwatch is a plugin-based file analysis framework for Suricata file stores.

The Nightwatch daemon looks for new files in the Suricata file extraction target
directory and calls various plugins to analyze them. JSON reports for every
scanned file as well as the plugin output can be forwarded to an AMQP consumer
for further analysis and storage. Nightwatch currently only supports AMQP (e.g.
RabbitMQ) as an output target.

## Current plugins

* _yarascan_: scans files with a YARA ruleset downloaded from a given URL

## Building the daemon

As the YARA plugin needs the YARA library files to build, you need to install
them first (e.g. in Debian/Ubuntu):

```
apt install libyara-dev libmagic-dev
```

Nightwatch uses the default Go build system. To build the binary in the `build`
sub directory simply use the supplied Makefile:

```
make
```

The static build can be executed with:

```
./build/nightwatch -h
```

## Testing

The test suite uses the regular Go test framework and can be invoked by running:

```
make test
```

## Usage

The daemon depends on various software components to be fully functional:

* Suricata configured to extract files and dump it to `-dir`
* RabbitMQ running and accepting deliveries on `-amqpexch` for `-amqpuser` and
  `-amqppass`

This is a dump of the current command line parameters:

```

## Running Nightwatch as a service

The `nightwatch.service` file is included to run Nightwatch if installed in
`/usr/local/bin`. It can be placed in `/etc/systemd/system` to make it usable
for the whole system (run `systemctl daemon-reload` afterwards to pick it up).
The `nightwatch.default` file can be copied to `/etc/default/nightwatch` for
easier configuration of parameters and already contains some defaults for
`-maxspace` and `-log`.

## Run-time control of the service

Once running, the behaviour of the service can be influenced by sending signals
to the `nightwatch` process:

* `SIGHUP`: reinitialize all plugins, e.g. reloading YARA rules
* `SIGUSR1`: rescans all files, without cleaning the existing database
* `SIGUSR2`: rescans all files from scratch, overwriting the existing database
